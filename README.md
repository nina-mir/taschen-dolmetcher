## Overview

This project is being built using a modern web tech stackâ€”primarily React v.19, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v.4. It provides interactive flashcards, phonetic guides, and historical insights about the crimes of Nazi Germany and its collaborators. By blending language practice with historical context, the project encourages users to reflect on the atrocities committed during World War II while acquiring practical linguistic skills.
