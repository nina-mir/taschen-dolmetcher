# Taschen-Dolmetcher <span style="color:yellow">&middot;</span> Revisited

## Overview

**Taschen-Dolmetscher Revisited** is an educational project that revives a World War 2-era phrasebook once used by German military to communicate with the people of the occupied Soviet Union, allowing learners to practice German, Russian, and English phrases while learning about the Holocaust and German war crimes. This game's material are inspired by real events, reportage from the frontlines, and artwork created by witnesses of the Holocaust and former partisans fighting fascists.

## motivation

This idea to create this work was initially prompted by

<img align="middle" width="400" src="https://asset.museum-digital.org//media/800/berlin/images/34/80372-207263/207263/207263-80372.jpg" />

- [a Wehrmacht-issued Russian translation booklet "Taschen-Dolmetscher für Frontsoldaten - Russisch (1941)"](https://berlin.museum-digital.de/object/80372)

and heavily inspired by

- Ilya Ehrenburg & Vasily Grossman's words from the Eastern Front (1941-1945)
- Artwork made by Soviet/Jewish partisans & survivors/witnesses of Holocaust
- The heroic/forgotten sacrifices of ordinary Soviet citizens in the face of the monstrous savagery of the German occupiers and the incompetency of Stalin

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts)](https://skillicons.dev)

This project is being built using a modern web tech stack—primarily React v.19, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v.4. It provides interactive flashcards, phonetic guides, and historical insights about the crimes of Nazi Germany and its collaborators. By blending language practice with historical context, the project encourages users to reflect on the atrocities committed during World War II while acquiring practical linguistic skills.
